We leveraged data from open-source datasets, and we had to pre-process the data where we standardized the data for training the machine learning algorithm. I have utilized Python libraries like numpy, pandas, sklearn (standardscaler, train_test_split, and accuracy_score) and support vector machine as our machine learning algorithm because SVM can be effective in situations with limited training samples and can handle non-linear classification using kernel functions. Our dataset consisted of 768 records. All the other aspects of the data had different ranges, so for training the machine learning model, we had to standardize all the data into a common range (commonly between 0 and 1).

Once our data was standardized, we had to split the data using the train test split function. After the data was split, we trained the ML model with the training data. The relationship in the data is mostly linear, so we will be utilizing the SVM with linear kernel function to train our model. Once our model was trained with the training dataset, we had to find out the accuracy score of the model with the test dataset. Once this was done, we concluded that our model had achieved an accuracy score of 77%.
